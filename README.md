# Manageable web dev challenge (for user story number 2)

<i>user story 2 - As a user, I want to be able to view available mentor slots and book one.</i>

- Hi Paul, I've completed the main objectives of this challenge however I want to make it clear this work isnt nearly as polished as id like it to be. Due to time constraints I didn't manage to complete things to my personal standards.

- For example, I started out mobile first, and didnt have enough time to optimise the desktop version.

- That being said, I think it's more than enough to have a conversation about and I'd love to talk about the things i would've done time permitting, and answer any questions you may have.

Thanks! Dan :)
